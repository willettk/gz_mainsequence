To the editor of MNRAS:

As with previous papers for Galaxy Zoo, we would like to request open access, pending acceptance, for this paper so that results can be shared with the volunteers who provided the morphological data. We are very grateful to MNRAS for offering this opportunity. 

- sincerely,
Kyle Willett and the GZ science team
