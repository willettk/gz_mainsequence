The paper « Galaxy Zoo: the dependence of the star formation-stellar mass relation on spiral disk morphology » compares the positions of star-forming galaxies of various disk morphologies to the best fitting line of the SFR-M* relation. This study presents an interesting discussion of e.g. the role of multiple arms in disk galaxies but suffers from a major problem that strongly limits the interpretation. All the analysis relies on the comparison of a sub-sample of the galaxies with a reference trend shown in the figures with a black solid line. It is the definition of this line, more precisely its slope and normalization that seems probmematic to me. 

Although this is not clearly stated in the text, this line was apparently obtained by fitting the whole sample of star-forming galaxies with no restriction in stellar mass or SFR. I believe that such fit can be misleading for the following reason. There is necessarily a completeness limit in SFR and this can be seen in the distribution of grey squares that represent the full sample in all the figures. Since all figures have overlayed on these gray squares some colored contours or points, the easiest is to look at the middle figure in Fig.2 where the full sample can be best seen. By eye, I would say that the completeness limit (which is obviously above the detection limit) in SFR is above 0.01 Msun/yr and probably not very far from 0.1 Msun/yr. This naturally implies that the stellar mass range around 10^7-10^8 Msun does not provide a robust measurement of the SFR-M* main sequence and should not be used to determine the best-fitting black solid line. 

The authors do not discuss at all the completeness of the sample but this is an important information for the following reason: at low masses, i.e. in the 10^7-8 Msun range, the fraction of galaxies with an enhanced sSFR is artificially enhanced leading to an overestimate of the sSFR in this range and therefore to an underestimate of the slope of the SFR-M* relation. The fact that the slope of the SFR-M* relation is affected by this effect can be seen in Fig.1 where all colored contours in each one of the 6 panels have their barycenter and central contours systematically above the black solid line. I would expect that if the authors were to only fit the full sample in the range where the sample is complete in SFR, they would find a better agreement between their contours and the black line. 

As a result, we would also expect the point made in the 6th paragraph of Section 3 to be revised. In that paragraph, it is written that two-armed spiral galaxies extend slightly below the SFMS. This statement suffers in my opinion from two uncertainties. First the one that I mentioned above, i.e. the reference line is biased by a domain affected by completeness. Second, this Narms=2 subsample contains 20 times more galaxies than Narms=1 and 6 times more than Narms=3, hence before concluding that the galaxies with Narms=2 include galaxies with low sSFR and interpreting this result, the authors should first make sure that this cannot be explained by a simple statistical effect, namely that one needs a very large sample of galaxies to start sampling the low sSFR galaxies.

In its present stage, the paper is not ready for publication since it does not provide a reliable justification of the slope of the SFR-M* relation for the whole sample of star-forming galaxies which is then used as a reference to discuss the position of various disk morphologies. We suggest that the author clearly establish a range in SFR and M* within which their galaxies fairly sample the SFR-M* relation, determine the slope of their reference trend in this range and not over the full galaxy sample including the very low SFR and M* ranges where the sample is biased due to incompleteness, and then use this new reference trend to make their comparison. If instead the authors consider their sample to fairly sample the SFR-M* relation they should explain why and explain the reason why all their subsamples are systematically biased toward higher sSFR in Fig.1. Finally, if they wish to keep their interpretation of an evidence of quenching of Narms=2 galaxies, they should discuss its statistical meaning, e.g. by randomly selecting in that sample 289 galaxies as in the Narm=1 sample and determining the % of cases where they get such low sSFR.

These changes should be very easy to make since they only concern the reference trend and they do not alter the main conclusions of the paper that rely on the comparison of the positions of each subsample, which remain unchanged e.g. in Fig.1 it will remain true that the various colored contours do not exhibit any major difference from one another. Similarly for the barred and unbarred galaxies in Fig.4 which will remain comparable. 


===========================================================

1. Clearly state in the text where the reference line comes from and how it was fit. 

    Easy enough to do. 

2. Look to the published MPA-JHU catalog for discussion of the formal completeness limit.

    10^8 M_sun - Brinchman+04. Dust attentuation is expected to be minimal in these systems. 

3. How can a completeness limit be estimated from the data itself? Where should it be set?

    Maybe a V/V_max test? Difficult since there are multiple lines being used ...

    Could also simply plot the SFR for our sample vs. the limits on star formation as a function of redshift vs. mass

4. Add 1-2 paragraphs discussing the completeness of the sample. 

    Set limit as above. 

5. Redo the fits for a "complete" sample, especially Fig 1. 
6. Revise 6th paragraph of Section 3 (arm multiplicity and galaxies that may be quenching). 
7. Test the 2-armed population; run multiple sub-samples at the sizes of other galaxies and examine what percentage of the time the same relation in SFMS is achieved. 
8. Add references and discussion from the AAS 225 session. (DONE)
9. Appendix or paragraph in the paper discussing the low-mass sample and whether it changes the results. 


9. Last round of proofreading.
